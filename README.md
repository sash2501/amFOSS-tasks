Task 3: Google Scraping using ruby: I am still trying to figure it out. I could do it for a website but not the main google page .



Task 9: I have tried to make a personal website by watching youtube videos. However, these are not the finished website,I am still working on it. I have to make many modifications in both websites.


References:Youtube videos, websites like:stackoverflow, quora,etc where so many of my questions were already answered.
