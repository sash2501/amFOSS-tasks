Task 0:Installed Ubuntu. Later on realised the touchpad drivers were not installed with the version of Ubuntu I had installed.
      Still working on the blog regarding the installation.
      
Task 3: Google Scraping using ruby: I am still trying to figure it out. I could do it for a website but not the main google page .

Task 7: Rusted email: I first tried basic coding in rust, like taking in values, printing them, etc by checking out various rust functions. I learnt about Cargo and use of regex.Then I came across the website [https://docs.rs/regex/1.1.9/regex/] (I realised it,only later that this link was already given in the doc)that I realised what I had to do for this task.

Task 9: I have tried to make a personal website by watching youtube videos. However, these are not the finished website,I am still working on it. I have to make many modifications in both websites.


References:Youtube videos, websites like:stackoverflow, quora,etc where so many of my questions were already answered.
